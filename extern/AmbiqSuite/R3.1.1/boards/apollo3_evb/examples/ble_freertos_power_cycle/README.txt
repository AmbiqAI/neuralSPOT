 ARM Cordio BLE - Power Cycling Apollo3 BLE Controller Example


Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates how to properly shutdown and restart the
BLE Controller in an operational system.  This includes the steps to restart
the ARM Cordio Host Stack in order to resynchronize with the BLE Controller.
The shutdown/restart process is driven by a 10 second WSF (Cordio) timer.

Printing takes place over the ITM at 1M Baud.
