Name:
=====
 deepsleep_shipmode


Description:
============
 Example demonstrating how to enter deepsleep with no memory retention

        and wakeup from an interrupt source followed by an immediate software
        reset



Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates deep sleep ship mode
 functionality for battery power preservation during shipping or shelf life.
 The application showcases power management with no memory retention,
 GPIO wake-up sources, and immediate software reset upon wake-up.

Section: Key Features
=====================

 1. Ship Mode Power: Implements deep sleep with no memory
    retention for battery preservation during shipping

 2. GPIO Wake Source: Provides GPIO interrupt wake-up source
    for flexible power management scenarios

 3. Software Reset: Implements immediate software reset upon
    wake-up for application restart capability

 4. Memory Management: Configures memory for low power with
    no retention in deep sleep for minimal power consumption

 5. Assembly Implementation: Uses pure assembly for sleep entry
    and reset to guarantee no unwanted stack access

Section: Functionality
======================

 The application performs the following operations:
 - Initializes memory for low power with no retention in deep sleep
 - Configures GPIO interrupt as wake-up source
 - Places device into deep sleep for battery preservation
 - Measures current draw during ship mode operation
 - Implements immediate software reset upon wake-up
 - Provides ship mode power management

Section: Usage
==============

 1. Compile and download the application to target device
 2. Monitor UART output at 115,200 BAUD for status messages
 3. Measure current draw during deep sleep operation
 4. Press push button to wake up the device
 5. Observe immediate software reset and device restart

Section: Configuration
======================

 - INTERRUPT_GPIO: GPIO pin for wake-up source configuration
 - Memory Retention: No memory retention for minimal power
 - Assembly Processing: Pure assembly implementation for reliability
 - UART Configuration: 115,200 BAUD, 8 bit, no parity

 Note: The API am_hal_PRE_SLEEP_PROCESSING which handles the deep sleep entry
 as well as the software reset command upon wakeup is written in pure assembly
 to guarantee no unwanted stack access generated by the compiler, as the stack
 would be invalid after the wakeup since all information will be lost when RAM
 is powered down in sleep.

 Text is output to the UART at 115,200 BAUD, 8 bit, no parity.
 Please note that text end-of-line is a newline (LF) character only.
 Therefore, the UART terminal must be set to simulate a CR/LF.
