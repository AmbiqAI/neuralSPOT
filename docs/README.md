# NeuralSPOT Document Guide

NeuralSPOT documentation is spread throughout the repository - generally, every component has its own documentation, which can be overwhelming. We've created the following high level documents as a starting point for understanding neuralSPOT's overall structure and intended usage.

The best way to read this documentation is here: [https://ambiqai.github.io/neuralSPOT](https://ambiqai.github.io/neuralSPOT)
