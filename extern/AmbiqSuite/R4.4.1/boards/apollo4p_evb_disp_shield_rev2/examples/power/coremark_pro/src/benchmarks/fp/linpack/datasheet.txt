Description:
This benchmark solves linear equations.

Application:
Part of the FPMark floating point suite.

Detailed Description:
The solution is obtained by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, 
and the implementation is derived from linpack.

Verification:
Verification is done based on IEEE-compliant run of ICC on a 64b linux machine with optimizations disabled, 
-fp-model precise -no-fast-transcendentals.
