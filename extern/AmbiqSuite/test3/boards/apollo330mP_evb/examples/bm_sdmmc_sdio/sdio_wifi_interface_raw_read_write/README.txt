 sdio_wifi_interface_raw_read_write


Description:
============
 sdio wifi interface read and write example.




Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates how to blocking DMA read & write
          APIs with WiFi device.

Additional Information:
=======================
 To enable debug printing, add the following project-level macro definitions.

 AM_DEBUG_PRINTF

 When defined, debug messages will be sent over ITM/SWO at 1MHz.

 Note that when these macros are defined, the device will never achieve deep
 sleep, only normal sleep, due to the ITM (and thus the HFRC) being enabled.
