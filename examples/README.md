# Examples

NeuralSPOT includes examples that are built entirely using NeuralSPOT's libraries and components, and are meant to showcase NeuralSPOT's features.

| Example                                                      | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [basic_tf_stub](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/neuralSPOT/tree/main/examples/basic_tf_stub) | NeuralSPOT's primary example, this audio-based AI model showcases Tensorflow integration, audio sampling and feature extraction, RPC, IPC, and more. It is used as the 'egg' for NeuralSPOT nests. |
| [mpu_data_collection](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/neuralSPOT/tree/main/examples/mpu_data_collection) | Shows how to configure and read sensor values from the [MPU6050](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/neuralSPOT/tree/main/neuralspot/ns-i2c), and how to use RPC to send those values to a PC. This is useful for creating accelerometer/gyroscope datasets, for example. |
| [rpc_client](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/neuralSPOT/tree/main/examples/rpc_client) | Shows how to use `ns-rpc` when the EVB is a *client* and the PC is the *server* to collect audio data from the AUDADC and dump it into a WAV file (useful for generating audio datasets). In this configuration, the EVB calls remote procedures and the PC executes those procedures . This example is designed to work with [`generic_data.py`](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/neuralSPOT/blob/main/neuralspot/ns-rpc/python/ns-rpc-genericdata/generic_data.py) (part of [ns-rpc](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/neuralSPOT/tree/main/neuralspot/ns-rpc)), a python script running on the PC that can be run as server or client. |
| [rpc_server](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/neuralSPOT/tree/main/examples/rpc_server) | Shows how to use `ns-rpc` when the EVB is the *server* and the PC is the *client*. In this configuration, the PC calls remote procedures and the EVB executes those procedures . This example is designed to work with [`generic_data.py`](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/neuralSPOT/blob/main/neuralspot/ns-rpc/python/ns-rpc-genericdata/generic_data.py) (part of [ns-rpc](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/neuralSPOT/tree/main/neuralspot/ns-rpc)), a python script running on the PC that can be run as server or client. |
