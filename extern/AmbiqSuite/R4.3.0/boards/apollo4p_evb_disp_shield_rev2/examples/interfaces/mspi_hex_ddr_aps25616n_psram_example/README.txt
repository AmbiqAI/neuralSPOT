=====
 mspi_hex_ddr_aps25616n_psram_example


Description:
============
 Example of the MSPI operation with DDR HEX SPI PSRAM APS25616N.


Purpose:
========
This example demonstrates MSPI DDR HEX operation using the APS25616N
PSRAM device.

Additional Information:
=======================
To enable debug printing, add the following project-level macro definitions.

AM_DEBUG_PRINTF

When defined, debug messages will be sent over ITM/SWO at 1M Baud.

Note that when these macros are defined, the device will never achieve deep
sleep, only normal sleep, due to the ITM (and thus the HFRC) being enabled.
