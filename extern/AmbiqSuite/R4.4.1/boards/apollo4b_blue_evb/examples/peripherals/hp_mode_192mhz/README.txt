 hp_mode_192mhz


Description:
============
 Example demonstrates the usage of High Performance Mode(192MHz) HAL.


Purpose:
========
This example sets the Apollo4 into High Power Mode(192MHz), then
times a calculation of prime numbers, displaying the elapsed time.
Next, it switches the Apollo4 into Low Performance Mode(96MHz), performs
the same calculation, then displays the elapsed time, which should be
roughly double the time of Low Power Mode.

The entire test takes around 30s to run on Apollo4.

Printing takes place over the ITM at 1M Baud.
