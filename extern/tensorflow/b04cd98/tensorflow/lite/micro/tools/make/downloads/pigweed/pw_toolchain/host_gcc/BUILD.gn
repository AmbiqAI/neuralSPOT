# Disable obnoxious ABI warning.
#
# GCC 7.1 adds an over-zealous ABI warning with little useful information
# on how to resolve the issue. The warning you get is:
#
#   note: parameter passing for argument of type '...' changed in GCC 7.1
#
# There is no other information, and searching for the error is needed to
# understand what is happening. For upstream Pigweed, we compile from
# source so this is irrelevant; so disable it.
#
# See: https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-7/changes.html (search for "psabi").
#      https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2017-05/msg00073.html
