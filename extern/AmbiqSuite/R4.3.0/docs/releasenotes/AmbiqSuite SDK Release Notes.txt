**********************************************************************************************
1Sep2022 Revision release_sdk_4_3_0-0ca7d78a2b

This is a combined release supporting updates to Apollo4/Apollo4 Blue RevB2 with an updated
release of Apollo4 Plus/Apollo4 Blue Plus Rev C0 (KBR and KXR devices).

**********************************************************************************************

SDK supports all Apollo4 evaluation boards from Ambiq.
- Apollo4b EVB (/boards/apollo4b_evb)
- Apollo4b Blue EVB (/boards/apollo4b_blue_evb)
- Apollo4b EVB with Rev 1 Display Shield (/boards/apollo4b_evb_disp_shield)
- Apollo4p EVB (/boards/apollo4p_evb)
- Apollo4p Blue KBR EVB (/boards/apollo4p_blue_kbr_evb)
- Apollo4p Blue KXR EVB (/boards/apollo4p_blue_kxr_evb) (NEW)
- Apollo4p EVB with Rev 2 Display Shield (/boards/apollo4p_evb_disp_shield_rev2) (NEW, replaces support for apollo4p_evb_disp_shield_rev1).

SDK includes a number of predefined examples for each configuration. See the file in /docs/List_of_Examples.txt.
Two new examples have been added to the Apollo4 Plus boards: audadc_power_cycling and tdm_loopback. 

SDK includes pre-built graphics examples using the Embedded Wizard (Tara Systems) GUI-Builder tool. These can be 
found at boards/apollo4p_evb_disp_shield_rev2/examples/graphics.  Support for this tool can be found at:
https://doc.embedded-wizard.de/getting-started-apollo4-display-kit?v=11.00

IDE/ToolChain Support:
----------------------
AmbiqSuite SDK supports GCC, IAR and Keil IDEs.
This release has been tested with:
- GCC 10.3.1 20210621 (release) [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain 10.3-2021.07]
- IAR ANSI C/C++ Compiler V9.20.2.320/W64 for ARM
- Keil: ARMCC 5060750, ARM Compiler 5.06 update 6 (build 750)
* For IAR EWARM, Apollo4 is natively supported with EWARM v9.10.2 and later.
* For Keil MDK, Apollo4 is supported by installing the CMSIS Ambiq Pack v1.2.9 or later.
* For either toolchain, either Apollo4 device is supported by selecting the AMAP42KK-KBR device.
* It is expected that J-Link and IAR will soon natively support Apollo4 Plus and Apollo4 Blue Plus
  devices. Keil MDK supports Apollo4 (Blue) Plus with the Ambiq Pack v1.3.0 or later (the latest
  Ambiq pack should be available via the MDK Pack Installer utility).
* In the interim, tools patches to support Apollo4 Plus are provided with this release. Please
  see the instructions provided in the /debugger_updates/ directory.
* By default, Apollo4 Plus projects in this release select the AMAP42KP-KBR device. Other
  Apollo4 Plus devices are also supported.

Notes:
------
* Provisioning and image tools for Apollo4 Plus and Apollo4 Blue Plus use the same infrastructure as Apollo4
  Use tools/apollo4b_scripts for the same
  
Known Issues:
-------------
* The tempco example is incompatible with Apollo4p EVBs, which contain earlier trim revision devices.  Trim revision 6 is required.
* The Power examples for Apollo4p EVBs will also result in sub-optimal power performance until trim revision 6 parts are available.
