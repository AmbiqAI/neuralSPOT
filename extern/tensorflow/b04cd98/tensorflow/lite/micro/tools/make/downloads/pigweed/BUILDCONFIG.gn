# This BUILDCONFIG file tells GN how to build upstream Pigweed. When starting a
# new project, you'll need to copy this file to your project and then modify it
# to fit your needs. Due to the way Pigweed handles file imports, you won't be
# able to simply import this file in your own BUILDCONFIG.gn.

# This is imported into a scope so as not to pollute the global variable space.
