Summary of Changes and Customer Impacts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a combined release supporting minor updates to Apollo3 and Apollo3 Plus release 3.1.0.

This release includes the following:
*	Updates to the HAL to handle the burst mode workaround instead of requiring the application
	to handle it at burst mode entry and exit. Includes updates to the binary_counter, 
	burst_mode, and coremark examples.
*	Added ble_freertos_throughput example back to the Apollo3 Blue Plus board.
* 	Fixed a BLE issue that resulted in a failure to re-advertise after disconnection.

\third_party\cordio\ble-host\sources\hci\ambiq\hci_core.c
*	Added CIS handle initialization to HciCoreInit and defaulted to 0. 

\third_party\cordio\ble-profiles\sources\apps\fit\fit_main.c
*       Updated fitSecCfg to intiate security upon connection.

Summary of Changes and Customer Impacts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a combined release supporting updates to Apollo3 and Apollo3 Plus

This release includes the following:
*	Updated Doxygen comments throughout the code. User guide added to \docs\user_guide\
*	Added support for ARM Compiler 6. Binaries and projects for older Keil/ARMCC 5060750 
	will not be provided after calendar year 2023.
* 	Cordio stack updated from r19.02 to r20.05. This update does not include the NVM service 
  	updates, which will be part of a future release.
*	Added Apollo3 Blue Plus power optimization patch code. Devices with and after date code
	212801 already have the required patch applied. Disabled by default. 
*	Added date and time input validation to RTC.
*	Updated temperature algorithms in ADC.
*	Fixed UART timeouts.
*	Fixed issue with waking from deepsleep and immediately executing flash operations.
*	Fixed possible race condition in IOM.
*	Fixed DTM test issue at cold temperatures.
*	Updated burst mode entry/exit sequence to prevent potential PSRAM code execution issue.
