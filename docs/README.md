# Neural Document Guide

NeuralSPOT documentation is spread throughout the repository - generally, every component has its own documentation, which can be overwhelming. We've created the following high level documents as a starting point for understanding neuralSPOT's overall structure and intended usage.

| Document                                                     | Description                                                  |
