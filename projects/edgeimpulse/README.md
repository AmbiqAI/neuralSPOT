# EdgeImpulse Examples

NeuralSPOT includes a port of EdgeImpulse's generic C++ library, making it easy to integrate AI projects generated by NeuralSPOT. See [here](../../docs/Deploying-EI-Models-using-neuralSPOT%20Nests.md) for a detailed walkthrough of how we used Nests to integrate EdgeImpulse models.

## Compiling EdgeImpulse Projects

These projects started as a Nest, which was modified to remove duplicated components such as Tensorflow and CMSIS-DSP and to include EdgeImpulse's SDK. Those modifications are captured in `projects/edgeimpulse/makefile`.

```bash
$> cd .../projects/edgeimpulse
$> make PROJECT=ei_yes_no
$> make deploy
$> make view
```

Each of these projects include all needed NeuralSPOT components plus the EdgeImpulse SDK and the exported EdgeImpulse model. To upgrade NeuralSPOT, use the nest make target. Nothing else is needed unless the new version requires NeuralSPOT API changes in the main model file.

To upgrade all of neuralSPOT in a project (in this example, ei_yes_no):

```bash
$> cd neuralSPOT
$> make clean # if needed
$> make # build neuralSPOT
$> make NESTDIR=project/edgeimpulse/ei_yes_no nest
```

To upgrade a single neuralSPOT component (in this example, ns-audio):

```bash
$> cd neuralSPOT
$> make clean # if needed
$> make # build neuralSPOT
$> make NESTDIR=project/edgeimpulse/ei_yes_no NESTCOMP=ns-audio nestcomponent
```
