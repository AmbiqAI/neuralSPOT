# NeuralSPOT BLE Library Subsystem

This library simplifies the instantiation of BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) services on bluetooth-enable Ambiq EVBs in order to enable BLE-based demonstration applications. Based on the Cordio BLE software stack, it adds a API and wrapping software to make creating BLE services easier. Features include:

- Easy definition of service behaviors and discoverability
- Easy definition of data elements ("characteristics" in BLE terms) that can be read, written, or subsribed to by BLE clients.
- Easy handling of read, write, and subscription event handling via application-definable callbacks

Current Limitations

- Only 1 service.
- Only 1 connection at a time.
- No "Out of band" connection protocol (in other words, the service will pair with the first client that requests it, rather than asking for a pin or other out-of-band confirmation).

**NOTE**: this library is in experimental phase - it is missing many features such as error handling and disconnections.

## Using NS BLE to Create a BLE Service

Creating a service involves:

1. Creating and configuring basic Service settings
2. Defining BLE "characteristics" (data sources/sinks), including read/write handlers
3. Adding the characteristics to the service
4. Starting the service.

#### A bit of BLE Terminology

A *BLE Server* is a peripheral that serves data (think heartrate monitors, thermometers, etc). Conversely, a *BLE Client* is the device that is interacting with that peripheral (think PC, smartphones, etc).

A *Service* runs on the BLE Server, and is a collection of data sources and sinks (aka *Characteristics*). It has a unique UUID.

A *Characteristic* is a data source (e.g. thermometer reading) or sink (e.g. thermometer units setting) associated with a service.

* There can be many characteristics associated with a Service, but each Characteristic can only be associated with one Service
* A data source can be read from the BLE Client, and a data sink can be written to. A Characteristic may be read-only, write-only, or read-write.
* A third type of Characteristics can be subscribed to by the Client - we call these *Notify* characteristics for simplicity. Once subscribed to, the Server will send value updates to the Client periodically.

### Creating a Service

The code snippet below creates a minimal Service, with a read-only, a read-write, and a notify Characteristic ('webble' refers to WebBLE, but this example can be connected to by any Client). For a full example, see [here](https://github.com/AmbiqAI/neuralSPOT/tree/main/examples/web_ble).

```c
#include "ns_ble.h"
#include "FreeRTOS.h"
#include "task.h"

float temperature = 0.0;          // Read Only
float accel[3] = {0.0, 0.0, 0.0}; // Notify
uint8_t rgb[] = {0, 0, 0};        // Read/Write
float x = 0.0; // mock-up sensor 'time'

/**
 * @brief Dummy up some interesting sensor values
 * (called every time the Notify period expires)
 */
static void webbleUpdateSensorValues(void) {
    // ns_lp_printf("webbleUpdateSensorValues\n");
    x += 0.1;
    if (x > 2 * PI) {
        x = 0.0;
    }
    accel[0] = arm_sin_f32(x);
    accel[1] = arm_cos_f32(x);
    accel[2] = arm_sin_f32(1 - x);
    temperature = arm_sin_f32(x / 2);
}
