  # individually by setting a module's config backend directly (e.g.
  # pw_some_module_CONFIG = "//my_config").
  #
  # Modules are configured through compilation options. The configuration
  # implementation might set individual compiler macros or forcibly include a
  # config header with multiple options using the -include flag.
