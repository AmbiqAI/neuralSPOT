V1.21.0.0 /- 21-Jan-2022
1. Integrated CEVA rw-ble-sw-v10.0.12 patches
(1) Do not apply slave latency when missing synchronization with master.
(2) Schedule more programming margin for wakeup activity. This will shorten the sleep time and cause a little higher average power consumption.
(3) Optimize the instant passed identification for PHY update and channel map update procedures.
(4) Minor change to prevent corruption of last transmitted packet when direct test mode is disabled.
(5) Do not report error when trying to disable one advertising activitiy which is already disabled.
(6) Fix to correctly report the high duty cycle directed advertising timeout failure.
(7) Update the ADI DID to make sure it is not the same as the previous one.
2. Free the released ACL RX buffer directly instead of assigning it to the RX descriptor to prevent memory leakage.
